Let's make this short, so you actually read it. The author has never
noticed any bugs, but still: If tal filters away your master's thesis
that's your problem! You are using this program ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!
On the other hand, it's free. You may even modify the code as long as the
starting comment at the beginning of the C file clearly mentions the
original author and just as clearly states the changes you have made.
Same thing for the manpage.

Of course the above is not a legally correct license, but I'm not a
lawyer, and I guess it's pretty clear what I mean. One day, as soon as
I understand it, I might put a fancy GNU GPL in this place.
