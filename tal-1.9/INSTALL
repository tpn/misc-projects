tal 1.9 Installation Notes

First, change the default settings at the top of the source file tal.c
according to your needs. However, changes are normally not required. 

If you have the OS environment variable set correctly, just type make.
Else type 'make youros' where youros is one of the following: 

          aix41                linux
          hpux9                osf1 (DEC alpha)
          hpux10               sunos4
          irix5 (for SGI)      sunos5
          irix6 (for SGI)

If your platform is not on the list, try all of the ones that are on the
list. You stand a good chance that one of them is working for you. In fact
I think tal will also compile on M$-DOS and other platforms that support
the ANSI C programming language. Anyway, the program is so simple that
compiling it really shouldn't be an insurmountable task.

After you have successfully compiled it, copy the resulting binary into a
directory that's in your PATH, and copy the man page into section 1 of a
manpage location that's in the MANPATH.


For use with vim, it might be nice to add a line such as

          vmap ,t !tal<CR>

to your ~/.vimrc. This way, you can select the lines using visual mode,
then press ',t' to have the trailers aligned. 

Read the man page for detailed information on tal's options.

That's it. Enjoy!
